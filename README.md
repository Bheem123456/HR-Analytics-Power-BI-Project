# HR-Analytics-Power-BI-Project
This project explores the utilization of HR analytics using Power BI, focusing on employee attendance patterns within Atliq, a  company in India. Leveraging the company's resources, a dataset comprising employee timesheets for April, May, and June of the year 2022 was obtained and analyzed.

The project aims to provide insights into employee attendance dynamics by visualizing key metrics such as the percentage of attendance, work from home, and sick leave occurrences. Through interactive visualizations, stakeholders can delve into attendance trends, identify patterns, and make data-driven decisions to optimize workforce management.

The analysis includes examining the distribution of leave days across different weekdays and segments of the month, allowing for the identification of potential trends and underlying reasons for leave occurrences. By comparing individual employee behaviors against aggregated data, managers can discern anomalies and proactively address attendance-related issues.

Overall, this project demonstrates the power of HR analytics in understanding employee behavior and facilitating informed decision-making for enhanced organizational efficiency and employee satisfaction.
